        <h2> Sports Car</h2>

            Early motor racing events included the 1903 Paris–Madrid race, the 1905-1907 Herkomer Trophy,[57] the 1908-1911 Prince Henry Tour and the 1911–present Monte Carlo Rally.[52] The Prince Henry Tours (which were similar to modern car rallies) were among the sporting events of the period, bringing renown to successful entrants. The Prince Henry Tours started the evolution of reasonably large and technically advanced production sports cars.[45][49]

In England, the development of sporting cars was inhibited by the Motor Car Act 1903, which imposed a speed limit of 20 mph (32 km/h) on all public roads. This led to the 1907 opening of the Brooklands motor circuit, which inspired the development of performance cars such as the 1910 Vauxhall Prince Henry, 1910 Sunbeam 12/16,[58] 1910 Talbot 25 hp, 1910 Straker-Squire 15 hp and 1913 Star
        </p>
        <p>The 1901 Mercedes, designed by Wilhelm Maybach for Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, deserves credit for being the first modern motorcar in all essentials.

            Its thirty-five-horsepower engine weighed only fourteen pounds per horsepower, and it achieved a top speed of fifty-three miles per hour. By 1909, with the most integrated automobile factory in Europe, Daimler employed some seventeen hundred workers to produce fewer than a thousand cars per year.
            
            Nothing illustrates the superiority of European design better than the sharp contrast between this first Mercedes model and Ransom E. Olds‘ 1901-1906 one-cylinder, three-horsepower, tiller-steered, curved-dash Oldsmobile, which was merely a motorized horse buggy. But the Olds sold for only $650, putting it within reach of middle-class Americans, and the 1904 Olds output of 5,508 units surpassed any car production previously accomplished.
            
            The central problem of automotive technology over the first decade of the twentieth century would be reconciling the advanced design of the 1901 Mercedes with the moderate price and low operating expenses of the Olds. This would be overwhelmingly an American achievement.</p>

        <p>Nicolas Joseph Cugnot of France built what is said to be the first automobile in 1769. While his invention is recognized by the British Royal Automobile Club and the Automobile Club de France as being the first, many history books say that the automobile was invented by either Gottlieb Daimler or Karl Benz.</p>
