                    Sports cars are high-performance vehicles designed for speed, agility, and driving pleasure. They typically have a sleek design and focus on handling and acceleration.
                    
                    ### Key Features
                    1. **Performance**: Sports cars often come with powerful engines (usually V6, V8, or turbocharged variants) that allow for rapid acceleration and high top speeds.
                    2. **Handling**: Enhanced suspension systems and lightweight materials contribute to better maneuverability and cornering capabilities.
                    3. **Aerodynamics**: Streamlined designs reduce drag, improving speed and fuel efficiency.
                    4. **RWD/AWD**: Many sports cars feature rear-wheel drive (RWD) for better handling, while all-wheel drive (AWD) is often used for improved traction.
                    5. **Technology**: Modern sports cars include advanced technology like adaptive cruise control, performance monitoring systems, and infotainment options.
                    
                    ### Popular Models
                    - **Porsche 911**: Renowned for its balance of performance and everyday usability.
                    - **Chevrolet Corvette**: Known for its powerful V8 engine and distinctive design.
                    - **Mazda MX-5 Miata**: Celebrated for its lightweight and agile handling.
                    - **Ferrari 488**: Offers exotic styling and exceptional performance.
                    
                    ### Purpose
                    Sports cars are often used for recreational driving, track days, and motorsport competitions. They appeal to enthusiasts looking for a thrilling driving experience.

                <h2></h2>
                <p>The 1901 Mercedes, designed by Wilhelm Maybach for Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft, deserves credit for being the first modern motorcar in all essentials.

                    Its thirty-five-horsepower engine weighed only fourteen pounds per horsepower, and it achieved a top speed of fifty-three miles per hour. By 1909, with the most integrated automobile factory in Europe, Daimler employed some seventeen hundred workers to produce fewer than a thousand cars per year.
                    
                    Nothing illustrates the superiority of European design better than the sharp contrast between this first Mercedes model and Ransom E. Olds‘ 1901-1906 one-cylinder, three-horsepower, tiller-steered, curved-dash Oldsmobile, which was merely a motorized horse buggy. But the Olds sold for only $650, putting it within reach of middle-class Americans, and the 1904 Olds output of 5,508 units surpassed any car production previously accomplished.
                    
                    The central problem of automotive technology over the first decade of the twentieth century would be reconciling the advanced design of the 1901 Mercedes with the moderate price and low operating expenses of the Olds. This would be overwhelmingly an American achievement.</p>
                <p>Although the automobile was to have its greatest social and economic impact in the United States, it was initially perfected in Germany and France toward the end of the nineteenth century by such men as Gottlieb Daimler, Karl Benz, Nicolaus Otto and Emile Levassor.</p>
                <p>The number of active automobile manufacturers dropped from 253 in 1908 to only 44 in 1929, with about 80 percent of the industry’s output accounted for by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, formed from Maxwell in 1925 by Walter P. Chrysler.</p>
